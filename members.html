		<div class="mem-type-title">General Members</div>

		<div class="mem-type-description" id="gen-description"> As a general member, you get the opportunity to become exposed to a flavor of ISAB without the full time commitment of being in core. You will be invited to ISAB exclusive events that will enable you to network with many other international students and give you exposure to international culture. Beyond this, you will also be included in the ISAB community through our family system that creates a bond between our core members as family heads and our general members as family members, allowing you to create a personal connection with a lot of other people in the club!</div>

		<div id="move"><div class="mem-type-title" id="core-title">Core Members</div>

		<div class="mem-type-description" id="core-description">Being a core member is being in the true heart of ISAB. You get everything that you would as a general member and more! As a core, we go on retreat together, we have an iBig/iLittle system, we have an end of semester banquet, we have socials and parties all semester, iDates to connect us with our ISAB alumni, every member is in a committee, and we meet every week to plan events, discuss committee progress, and ultimately just connect with one another. Through all this, our core members become an incredibly close family, which is what ISAB is all about!</div>
